# MAGIC **NOTE**: If you get a missing library error for mlflow for the above cell. Create a cell **above** the previous cell with all the library imports and add this:

# MAGIC ### Upload and Read Sensor Dataset  
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The dataset that we will use to train the model is provided in the GitHub repository for this workshop. We can simply clone this repository to the cluster itself and read the data file. This makes it easy for us here in the lab environment, but typically our datasets are not this small. This step would usually be a read operation from Azure Data Lake Storage, AWS S3, or Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

# MAGIC ## Step 1: Train the Model with MLFlow

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC With our sensor data table saved, we can create an MLFlow Experiment to house the metrics that we log during our training runs.  
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC First, within our workspace, we need to create a location for the experiment to be created. Go to a location and create a folder to hold the experiment. Copy the path to the newly-created folder into the `PATH_TO_MLFLOW_EXPERIMENT` variable.  
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC Next, we first establish a `MlflowClient()` which gives us a connection to the MLFlow Tracking Server and allows us to issue commands via the MLFlow API to do things like create experiments, which we do using `client.create_experiment()`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Prepare Data for Training

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC In this next cell, we take the sensor data and create test and training datasets by splitting up the table using a randomized distribution of data.

# COMMAND ----------

import pandas as pd
import random

#Setup Test/Train datasets
data = dataDf.toPandas()
x = data.drop(["Device", "Time", "Sensor5"], axis=1)
y = data[["Sensor5"]]

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Train Model  
# MAGIC With our training and test dataset ready, we are able to run a few training runs for our model.  
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC We are going to run three runs of the `RandomForestClassifier` from sklearn using the following parameters:  
# MAGIC ```python
# MAGIC numEstimators = [10, 15, 20]
# MAGIC maxDepths = [15, 20, 25]
# MAGIC ```  
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC We will also be leveraging the sklearn autologger to log the parameters for each run, as well as key metrics and the trained model itself. The autologging capabilities of MLFlow make it even easier to get started with training your models and tracking your model performance over various training runs.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC In this part of the lab, we will demonstrate a potential flow for testing the model and then transitioning the model to the "Production" state.  
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC We will use this example request to test the model:  
# MAGIC ```json
# MAGIC {"columns": ["Sensor1", "Sensor2", "Sensor3", "Sensor4"], "data": [[70.4843795946883, 18347.021600937504, 51.38152543807783, 71.97184461064535]]}
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC On your own, follow along in the MLFlow Registry by going to the "Models" tab on the left-hand bar of the Databricks Workspace.  
# MAGIC   
# MAGIC After we are done in the registry, we will come back to this notebook.  
# MAGIC
